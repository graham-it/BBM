Release notes
-------------

Version 1.03 (first release)
released on August 28, 2025

Bugs (noticed by WIL of CSDb):
- Key to skip current file:
  displayed <crsr/right> istead of <crsr/down>

- Works only with M/L programs that start with a BASIC sub (e.g. 10 SYS2061).
  Applied to normal BASIC programs, new variables are allocated over
  the program itself! 

========================================

Version 1.03++ (bugfix)
released on August 30, 2025

Fixed bugs:
- Key to skip current file: fixed

- Boot header modified to include BASIC pointers (VARTAB, ARYTAB and STREND).
  This way BBM works with all kind of programs that reside in BASIC text area!

Notes:
- File length, used to determine VARTAB pointer, suggested by WIL of CSDb:
  VARTAB_hi = blocks_lo + 8 (first page of BASIC text area)

- Versioning (V1.03++) wrong due a misunderstood with iAN Coog of CSDb.

========================================

Version 1.04
released on September 2, 2025

Improvements:
- Load start address included into Boot header data, to simplify target file
  writing;

- Data buffer extended to 4 KB (originally was 256 bytes only) to reduce head
  seeking during disk access (harmful on real drives) and to speed-up the
  file copy process;

- Improved user information display.
